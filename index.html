        Feminism drew directly upon Chinese concepts, strategies, and
        inspiration, yet very few studies, with only a few exceptions, mention,
        let alone delve into, China’s legacy of inspiring, indeed making what we
        now think of as “Western” feminism. This Eurocentrism is typical of many
        studies of globalization, which assume that the West is the sole
        innovator of social change. <br />

          >For example, in 1950, the first year of Mao’s rule, China
          criminalized forced marriages and legalized divorce, far earlier than
          most countries. After the establishment of the People’s Republic of
          China in 1949, China became a significant model for women’s liberation
          in the West. <br /><br />Although this role has received inadequate
          scholarly attention it is essential for understanding how the Chinese
          government’s policies are currently evaluated by feminists outside
          China. This Western valorizing of China as an example of women’s
          liberation was not based purely on fantasy. In the 1950s and 60s real
          changes that were truly revolutionary did take place for Chinese
          women. </span

          >The way women's bodies in contemporary China are now a key site of
          government regulation due to population control policies makes China a
          women’s dystopia for many Western feminists.<br /><br />This means
          that some of the unintended, but beneficial for women, consequences of
          China’s planned birth policies have gone largely unremarked in the
          English language literature. One unintended outcome has been a
          generation of young women who have had unprecedented access to family
          and state resources. The first generation of women born since the
          introduction of planned birth are also the first generation of women
          in China’s history to have received total family support and access to
          resources. Traditional attitudes towards gender are changing. Despite
          a discrepancy between the lives of rural and urban women, both groups
          of young women are living more autonomous lives than their mothers.<br /><br />In
          contrast, the English language literature on Chinese population
          policies tends to emphasize other undesirable, unintended consequences
          such as the gender ratio imbalance known as the ‘bachelor army’ of men
          unable to find partners and its corollary, an increase in sexual
          trafficking.<br /></span
        ><span id="introp5copy2red"
          ><br />China’s position first as a model for revolutionary women’s
          liberation during the Maoist Era and later in the Economic Reform Era
          as the world’s largest patriarchy creates a blind spot towards China
          which renders positive outcomes from Chinese population policies
          invisible. Therefore, it is important to explore how China and the
          status of women in China has appeared to Western feminists.</span
